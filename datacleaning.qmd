# Data Cleaning

Here you will show the steps for taken to clean/merge the original dataset(s) to the dataset used in your final analysis. 

Let people know this is simulated data. 

Everything should be readable and documented. No large printed tables. If you need to print a table, use features like scrolling or tabs.
